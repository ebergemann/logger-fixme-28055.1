  NOTE:
  This is here just so this file compiles when running the tests. I had an import issue and an issue mocking Date and ran up to a couple hours so I decided to stop here.
  Were I to finish testing, I would use mocks to mock out the console and file log calls to check that they were receiving the right messages.
